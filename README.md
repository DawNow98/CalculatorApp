CalculatorApp ðŸ§®


Purpose

The calculatorApp is a visually stunning and fully functional calculator that combines elegant design with a robust mathematical backend. Built with SwiftUI, this app is optimized for both portrait and landscape modes, making it versatile across various device orientations. It includes support for basic, advanced, and scientific operations, showcasing proficiency in user interface (UI) design and dynamic state management.

Features
1. Dynamic UI Design:
- Adaptive layout adjusts seamlessly between portrait and landscape orientations.
- Vibrant gradient background for an engaging visual experience.
- Button styles and font sizes dynamically adapt to screen size and orientation.
2. Full Calculator Functionality:
- Basic operations: Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- Advanced functions: Square root, percentage, trigonometric operations (sin, cos, tan), logarithmic functions, and exponential calculations.
- Modular design supports future extensions like scientific operations.
3. Intuitive Button Grid:
- Calculator buttons arranged in a clean and accessible grid.
- Dynamic button size ensures usability on various devices (iPhones and iPads).
4. Real-Time Calculations:
- Instantly displays results after every input or operation.
- Error handling for invalid inputs (e.g., division by zero or square root of negative numbers).
5. Dark Mode Friendly:
- Optimized colors and gradients ensure readability and aesthetic appeal across all modes.


Skills Demonstrated
1. Advanced SwiftUI UI/UX Design:
- Gradient-based themes and rounded button designs for a polished look.
- Adaptive layout using GeometryReader for device orientation and screen size changes.
- Smooth animations and transitions for a delightful user experience.
2. State Management with SwiftUI:
- Used @StateObject and @Published properties to manage user inputs and calculator states efficiently.
- Ensured reactive updates to the UI based on changes in the CalculatorViewModel.
3. Mathematical Operations:
